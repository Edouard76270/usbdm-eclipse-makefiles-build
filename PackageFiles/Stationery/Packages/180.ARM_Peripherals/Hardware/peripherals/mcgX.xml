FLL Engaged Internal(FEI)\n
In FEI mode, MCGOUT is derived from the FLL clock (DCOCLK) that is controlled by the 32 kHz Internal Reference Clock (IRC).\n
The FLL loop will lock the DCO frequency to the FLL factor, as selected by the C4[DRST_DRS] and C4[DMX32] bits, times the\n
internal reference frequency.\n
\n
FLL Engaged External(FEE)\n
In FEE mode, MCGOUT is derived from the FLL clock (DCOCLK) that is controlled by the external reference clock. The FLL loop\n
will lock the DCO frequency to the FLL factor, as selected by C4[DRST_DRS] and C4[DMX32] bits, times the external reference\n
frequency, as specified by the C1[FRDIV] and C2[RANGE].\n
\n
FLL Bypassed Internal(FBI)\n
In FBI mode, the MCGOUT clock is derived either from the slow (32 kHz IRC) or fast (2 MHz IRC) internal reference clock,\n
as selected by the C2[IRCS] bit. The FLL is operational but its output is not used. This mode is useful to allow the FLL\n
to acquire its target frequency while the MCGOUT clock is driven from the C2[IRCS] selected internal reference clock. The\n
FLL clock (DCOCLK) is controlled by the slow internal reference clock, and the DCO clock frequency locks to a multiplication\n
factor, as selected by the C4[DRST_DRS] and C4[DMX32] bits, times the internal reference frequency.\n
\n
FLL Bypassed External(FBE)\n
In FBE mode, the MCGOUT clock is derived from the external reference clock. The FLL is operational but its output is not\n
used. This mode is useful to allow the FLL to acquire its target frequency while the MCGOUT clock is driven from the\n
external reference clock. The FLL clock (DCOCLK) is controlled by the external reference clock, and the DCO clock frequency\n
locks to a multiplication factor, as selected by the C4[DRST_DRS] and C4[DMX32] bits, times the divided external reference\n
frequency.\n
\n
PLL Engaged External(PEE)\n
In PEE mode, the MCGOUT is derived from the PLL clock, which is controlled by the external reference clock. The PLL clock\n
frequency locks to a multiplication factor, as specified by C6[VDIV0], times the external reference frequency, as specified\n
by C5[PRDIV0].\n
\n
PLL Bypassed External(PBE)\n
In PBE mode, MCGOUT is derived from the OSCSEL external reference clock; the PLL is operational, but its output clock is\n
not used. This mode is useful to allow the PLL to acquire its target frequency while MCGOUT is driven from the external\n
reference clock. The PLL clock frequency locks to a multiplication factor, as specified by its [VDIV0], times the external\n
reference frequency, as specified by its [PRDIV0].\n
\n
Bypassed Low Power Internal (BLPI/FBILP)\n
In BLPI mode, MCGOUT is derived from the internal reference clock. The FLL is disabled and PLL is disabled even if the\n
C5[PLLCLKEN] is set to 1.\n
\n
Bypassed Low Power External (BLPE/FBELP)\n
In BLPE mode, MCGOUT is derived from the external reference clock. The FLL is disabled and PLL is disabled even if the\n
C5[PLLCLKEN] is set to 1.">

 \section sectionConstruction Construction.
   -  Build the hardware using the information provided in the <b>PCB</b> download.
   -  The following are provided:
      - PDFs including the circuit diagrams with parts lists and example PCB layouts.
      - PCB layouts in Altium designer format (a trial version of the software may be down loaded from http://altium.com/evaluate/). 
      - PCB layouts exported from Altium designer as Gerber files and NC drill files.
      
\section sectionInitialProgramming Initial programming of USBDM bootloader into BDM Flash.

   -  If you purchased a commercial version of the BDM with Version 4.0 or later software then the correct USBDM bootloader should have 
      already been installed and you may go to \ref sectionUpdate to update the BDM firmware.  If the software is Ver 3 then
      you are advised to update all the flash including the bootloader.

\if JS16
   -  Please complete the following before the next step:
      -  Install the USBDM software \ref softwareInstallationPage  
      -  Install the USBDM drivers \ref driverPage  \n

   -  <b>Note - Two bootloaders are used in programming the JS16 BDM</b>
      - The JS16 has an inbuilt USB bootloader.  This is used with the provided JS16 First Stage Bootloader to initially program the JS16.
      - The USBDM has its own bootloader.  This is necessary for the JMxx versions and for consistency is also used with
        the JS16 versions.  This bootloader has to be programmed into the BDM once (using the built-in bootloader from above!)\n
      
   -  If the BDM is completely unprogrammed you can simply plug it in, otherwise tie the BLMS pin low before doing so.\n
   
   -  The same driver is used by the JS16 Bootloader as used by the USBDM software so should install automatically.
   
   -  If you are having problems detecting the device or are not prompted for the driver you can confirm that the BDM is
      in Freescale bootloader mode by checking the device PID/VID in the device manager.  It should be VID=15A2 & PID=0038 and
      the device should appears as <b>JS16 Bootloader</b> in the device manager when the driver is correctly installed.\n
      
   -  <b>If you have previously used the Freescale JS16 GUI Bootloader then it may be necessary to uninstall the device first
      using the Device Manager.</b>

   -  Start the JS16 Bootloader.\n
      - Select the appropriate firmware to load to the device.
      - Press Program to program the device.  There is no progress dialogue but after a short wait a confirmation should appear.
      -  You should then use the USBDM Firmware updater to install the current firmware version as described below. \n \n

   - <b> Note </b> - The above loader replaces the Freescale GUI Loader used previously.  This was needed as it appears the
     Freescale software & driver does not install under Windows 64-bit.
      
\endif
\if JMxx 
   -  Program your JMxx with the binary files provided. The required flash images are installed with the USBDM software
      and are available from the USBDM start menu. PDFs of the circuit corresponding to each hardware is provided to 
      identify the correct firmware version to load.\n  
      <b>This requires a HCS08 BDM.</b>  \n
      To save space a 4-pin programming header has been used on the BDM.  An adapter is needed to connect to a
      standard BDM header.  This would consist of a 6-pin socket wired to a 4-pin header as shown below:  I have 
      found that if you slightly splay the 4-pin header it will make a quite reliable connection when directly 
      inserted into a PTH board without soldering. It may then be easily removed.\n
      Alternatively, wires may be temporarily soldered to the BDM.   \n

\endif

   - <b>Note that the above programming is only needed once.</b>  Updating of the firmware is done via the <i>USBDM Firmware Bootloader</i>  - see below.\n
   This also allows changing the USB serial number. \n\n

 \section sectionUpdate Update of BDM firmware and changing serial number
   This is the usual process for updating the BDM between different levels of the Version 4 firmware.\n
   -  Please complete the following before the next step (if not already done):
      -  Install the USBDM software \ref softwareInstallationPage  
      -  Install the USBDM drivers \ref driverPage  \n \n
   -  The provided USBDM Firmware Updater (FirmwareChanger.exe - not the JS16 First stage one!) may be used to change the BDM firmware.  
      Its use is pretty obvious.\n
      These required flash images are installed with the USBDM software and the correct one will be automatically loaded if the
      <b>Auto update BDM firmware</b> checkbox is selected.\n
      It also allows the serial number of the BDM to be changed as part of the programming process.  This is desirable as the serial
      number is used to identify a particular BDM if several are plugged in at the same time. \n\n
   <b>Notes:</b>\n
   -  The bootloader re-boots the BDM into USBDM in-circuit-programming (USBDM-ICP) mode to change the main firmware.  The device will be 
      re-enumerate and appears as a <b>new device</b>.  You may be prompted to allow driver installation.
   -  The Bootloader will not allow the programming of a Flash image that doesn't match the existing BDM type i.e. whatever was originally
      programmed into the BDM.  This is to prevent accidental upgrade with an incompatible Flash image.
   -  The Bootloader requires the BDM to have already been programmed at least once so that the Bootloader firmware is present in the BDM.
   -  If the BDM contains an old version of the Bootloader firmware (USBDM < V4.0) then it is necessary to take special steps to install the 
      USB drivers to support both old and new VID/PIDs.  Please see the driver installation instructions. \ref NoteOnFirmwareChange \n\n

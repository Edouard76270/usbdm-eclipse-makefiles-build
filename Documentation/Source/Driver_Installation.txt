\section InstallingDriversSectionWindows Installation of USBDM USB drivers for Windows
  
There are four installers provided: \n
- <b>USBDM_Drivers_x_x_x_WinXP_x32.msi</b> - Windows XP 32-bit
- <b>USBDM_Drivers_x_x_x_WinXP_x64.msi</b> - Windows XP 64-bit
- <b>USBDM_Drivers_x_x_x_Win_x32.msi</b> - Windows 7 32-bit
- <b>USBDM_Drivers_x_x_x_Win_x64.msi</b> - Windows 7 64-bit

<b>Note:</b> On Windows, libusb1.0 is a thin wrapper around the Microsoft winUSB low-level USB drivers.  Because
of this you may see references to winusb in the following.\n
<b>Note:</b> These drivers are signed.\n

Please install the drivers before plugging in a BDM. \n

Steps to follow under WIN-7 (it's similar for WIN-XP but there will be other confirmation dialogues).  
Windows 8 and 10 are less talkative.
   - Download the appropriate driver installation file (as above) from Sourceforge:
   <A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/projects/usbdm/files/Version%204.12.1/Drivers/">USBDM Sourceforge</A>\n
   - Remove the BDM if it is already plugged in.
   - Install the driver .msi file.  This should clean out any incompatible driver files.
   - You will be prompted by a UAC dialogue to allow the installation of the drivers.

   - After installing the drivers, plugging in a BDM should trigger the actual driver installation. \n

   - If you click on the pop-up you can confirm the driver installation steps.\n
     In the case shown below drivers for the BDM interface and the serial port (CDC) interface are installed.

\section InstallingDriversSectionLinux Installation of USBDM USB drivers for Linux
There isn't any.  The DEB file provided will modify the /etc/udev/rules.d file to allow
access to the USBDM device. The required driver for USBDM BDM interface (LibusbV1) is included in the standard
Linux (at least Ubuntu current version).  The CDC (serial port) is a standard device and should also be installed
without any extra steps.

If more installation is required on your version you will have to investigate this yourself.  I'm not a Linux 
expert and I don't have access to other versions for testing.  If you find other steps are necessary then please
 advise and I will try to update the installation accordingly.

 The shell scripts supplied with the linux version should install the required information for the libusb drivers 
 to work on a linux machine.
 
 You will also need to make sure you have installed some libraries:

  Hello PGO,
  
  I just tried your version 4.6 with Codewarrior 10.1 on a clean install of Ubuntu 11.04 (32 bit).
  In case it helps anyone else trying this, it required adding the following libraries with the 
  Synaptic Package Manager:
    - tcl8.5 
    - libwxgtk2.8-0 
    - lbwxgtk2.8-dbg 
    - libstdc++5 
    - libxerces-c3.1
  Then it seems to run fine.
  Many thanks and best regards!
   
  Robert
